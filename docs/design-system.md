# Design system

How the app looks and which pieces it is built from. Everything lives in `crates/app/src/shared/`: `ui.rs` (tokens, components and motion), `themes.rs` (catalog and active theme), `banner.rs` and `surge.rs` (brand and pixel art effects) and `assets.rs` (icons). Views use these pieces instead of loose colors and sizes, so every screen looks like the others.

## Principles

These principles come from the current code. They are not aspirations.

| Principle | How it applies |
| --- | --- |
| **Translucent glass** | The window requests `WindowBackgroundAppearance::Blurred` and a transparent title bar (`crates/app/src/app/mod.rs`). Surfaces (`panel`, `surface`, `well`…) are the theme background, tinted and with alpha, so the blurred desktop shows through. What floats on top (menus, screens, palette) is opaque: `popover_bg` and `screen_bg` have alpha 1 at any transparency. |
| **No lines in the chrome** | The title bar has no border (`title_bar_border = clear` in `ui::apply_theme`). Panels and the sidebar have a transparent `border_1()`; only the focused panel of a split shows a `petal().opacity(0.45)` border (`features/workspace/view.rs`). Dividers between panels are a 6 px gap (`DIVIDER`) with a 2×40 px handle that appears in `petal()` only on hover. Inside, zones are separated by space and by the change of surface (`panel` → `surface` → `well`). |
| **Thin lines only in screens** | Inside an overlay screen there is a `ui::border()` line between header, body and footer (`screen_header` uses `border_b_1`, footers use `border_t_1`), and Settings rows use `border().opacity(0.5)`. No more are added. |
| **Petal as accent** | The brand pink (the theme's `accent`) is reserved for what is live and primary: the dot that pulses while the agent works, the `✿ phase…` text, the focused panel, primary buttons and the welcome glow. It is not used as a background fill. |
| **Dense but calm** | `text_xs` is the most used size and `muted` the most used color (more than `fg`). Semantic color goes on icons, chips and card borders, not on large blocks. Animations last 220–420 ms and overshoot by no more than ~3 %. |

## Color

### Where colors come from

```text
themes/*.json (Pi theme format)
  → themes::parse_pi_theme   → Theme (opaque colors 0xRRGGBB)
  → ui::Palette::new(theme, clear)   → roles with alpha, based on transparency
  → ACTIVE (global RwLock in themes.rs)
  → ui::fg(), ui::surface()…  (read via themes::palette(|p| …), no cx)
  → ui::apply_theme(cx)       → gpui-component colors (buttons, inputs, lists, menus)
```

- **Catalog** (`themes::load_catalog`): first the Gentle Shell themes embedded with `include_str!` from `crates/app/themes/` (`Gentleman-Cute`, `Gentleman-Sexy`, `Gentle`); themes installed in `<gentle-pi>/themes/` replace them by name. Then the user's themes in `<agent dir>/themes/` and finally the popular schemes in `SCHEMES`. Names are unique; the first one wins.
- **Initial theme** (`themes::pick_default`): the one saved in `dirs::data_dir()/gentle-shell-gpui/settings.json` (key `theme`), otherwise the `theme` from Pi's `settings.json`, otherwise `DEFAULT_THEME` (`"Gentleman-Cute"`).
- **Live changes**: `themes::select(index, cx)` and `themes::set_transparency(clear, persist, cx)` reinstall the palette, call `ui::apply_theme` and refresh all windows. Because tokens are read on every render, no view stores colors.

JSON fields used by `parse_pi_theme` (the rest of Pi's format is ignored, except for the terminal's ANSI table):

| `Theme` | JSON | If missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bg` | `export.pageBg`, otherwise `vars.bg` | `0xffffff` light / `0x0e0e11` dark |
| `fg`, `muted`, `faint` | `colors.text`, `colors.muted`, `colors.dim` | mixes of `fg` and `bg` |
| `accent`, `accent_active` | `colors.accent`, `colors.borderAccent` | `fg`; mix of `accent` and `fg` |
| `raised` | `colors.userMessageBg` | `mix(bg, accent, 0.14)` |
| `border` | `colors.border` | `mix(bg, fg, 0.25)` |
| `heading` | `colors.toolTitle`, otherwise `colors.mdHeading` | `warning` |
| `info` | `vars.blue`, otherwise `colors.syntaxFunction` | ANSI blue |
| `success`, `danger`, `warning` | `colors.success`, `colors.error`, `colors.warning` | fixed values |
| `selection` | `colors.selectedBg` | `mix(bg, accent, 0.25)` |

`light` is decided by the luminance of `bg` (> 0.5), or that of `text` if there is no background.

### Tokens

All are argument-less functions in `crate::shared::ui` that return `Hsla`.

| Token | Comes from | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fg()` | `fg` | Main text, titles, values. |
| `muted()` | `muted` | Secondary text, subtitles, header icons, card bodies, loading states. |
| `faint()` | `faint` | Metadata, hints, icons inside fields, `section_label`, "N more" counters. |
| `accent()` | `accent` | Interactive things: links, focus, selection, the current session, running jobs. |
| `petal()` | `accent` (the same color) | The brand: live dot, `✿`, focused panel, glows, effects. |
| `petal_active()` | `accent_active` | Stronger variant of `petal`. |
| `champagne()` | `heading` | Tool card titles, Settings section icons, highlighted code. |
| `info()` | `info` | Models, tool chips, "running" state. |
| `success()` / `danger()` / `warning()` | same names | States; also on card borders with `.opacity(0.35)`. |
| `panel()` | background tinted 4.5 % | Panels, sidebar. |
| `surface()` | background tinted 9 % | Cards (`card`), keys (`kbd`), secondary buttons. |
| `surface_hover()` | background tinted 15 % | Hover on rows and collapsible headers; active row in menus. |
| `raised()` | `raised` | User messages, selected row, active option of `segmented`. |
| `well()` | barely tinted background | Sunken: code, outputs, text fields, `segmented` frame. |
| `border()` | background tinted 20 %, alpha 0.69 (dark) / 0.8 (light) | Card borders and thin lines in screens. |
| `border_strong()` | `border`, opaque | Fields, keys, frame of screens and islands, vertical separators. |
| `screen_bg()` | background tinted 5.5 %, opaque | Full screens and palette. |
| `popover_bg()` | background tinted 6.5 %, opaque | Islands, menus, floating cards. |
| `backdrop()` | black, alpha 0.44 (dark) / 0.25 (light) | Veil behind screens (`scrim`) and shadow color of `island`. |

"Tinted" is `mix(bg, mix(fg, accent, 0.6), amount)`: the background leaned toward the text with a touch of the accent. `Palette` also has fields without a public function (`window_bg`, `accent_deep`, `on_accent`, `danger_hover`, `danger_active`, `selection`, `scrollbar_hover`) that only `apply_theme` uses.

### Transparency

`Palette::new(theme, clear)` receives the window transparency (`clear`, 0 = most solid glass, 1 = clearest; default `DEFAULT_TRANSPARENCY = 0.6`, adjustable with the Settings slider). Each glass surface lowers its alpha from a solid value down to a floor that keeps text readable (`fade(solid, floor)`); for example `panel` goes from 0.93 to 0.16 and `surface` from 0.94 to 0.4. `popover_bg` and `screen_bg` do not change.

**OLED themes** (`Theme::oled`, today only *OLED Black*) ignore transparency: `window_bg`, `panel`, `well` and `screen` are opaque `#000000` so an OLED panel turns those pixels off, and cards, menus and user messages are opaque layers just above black. Don't add tints or glows that would light large areas in that theme.

### gpui-component

`ui::apply_theme(cx)` switches `ThemeMode` to light or dark according to `Palette::light` and rewrites the gpui-component colors, so the stock components already match:

| gpui-component | Token |
| --- | --- |
| `primary`, `button_primary`, `ring`, `link`, `progress_bar`, `slider_bar` | `accent` (hover: `accent_active`; text: `on_accent`) |
| `button`, `secondary`, `muted` | `surface` (hover `surface_hover`, active `raised`) |
| `danger`, `button_danger` | `danger` |
| `list_hover` / `list_active` / `tab_active` | `surface_hover` / `raised` / `raised` |
| `popover` | `popover_bg` |
| `input`, `window_border`, `scrollbar_thumb` | `border_strong` |
| `title_bar`, `title_bar_border`, `tab_bar`, `tab`, `list`, `scrollbar` | transparent |
| `radius` / `radius_lg` | 8 px / 12 px |

### Light and dark

Views do not branch by mode: they use tokens. The differences live in `Palette::new` (alpha of `window_bg`, untinted `well` in light, alpha of `border`, white `on_accent` in light, softer `backdrop`) and in `apply_theme` (gpui-component's `overlay`). If something really needs it, read it with `themes::palette(|p| p.light)`.

## Typography

- **UI font**: gpui-component's (`cx.theme().font_family`); the app does not change it. `ui::island` sets it explicitly so a menu opened from a monospaced bar does not inherit that font.
- **Monospaced**: `ui::MONO` is `"Menlo"` on macOS, `"Consolas"` on Windows and `"DejaVu Sans Mono"` elsewhere. It is used for paths, settings values, code, counters, clocks and tokens. `well_box` and `kbd` already apply it.
- **Scale**: the rem is gpui-component's `font_size` (16 px), so `text_xs` = 12 px, `text_sm` = 14 px and `text_base` = 16 px.

| Size | Weight | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 px | `SEMIBOLD`, uppercase | `section_label` |
| 10.5 px | normal | `chip`, `kbd` |
| 11–12 px | normal | Hints, status chip rows, tool subjects in `MONO` |
| 13 px | `SEMIBOLD` | Card title (in `champagne`); card body in 13 normal |
| 14 px | normal / `SEMIBOLD` | Message and composer text; titles of error cards and dialogs |
| `text_xs` | normal | Screen subtitles, rows, metadata (the most used) |
| `text_sm` | normal / `MEDIUM` | Row titles, empty and loading states; title of a chip's card |
| `text_base` | `SEMIBOLD` | Screen title in `screen_header` |
| `text_lg` / `text_xl` | `SEMIBOLD` | Agent name, onboarding hero |
| 17 px | `SEMIBOLD`, `petal` | Effort control title |
| 34 px / line height 42 | `BOLD` | Welcome heading |
| 72 px and up | `EXTRA_BOLD`, `petal` | The word at the end of the welcome |

`SEMIBOLD` is the weight for titles; `MEDIUM` for small titles inside floating cards; `BOLD` and `EXTRA_BOLD` only in the welcome.

## Spacing and radii

| Radius | Size | Used in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rounded_md` | 6 px | `chip`, `kbd`, `segmented` options |
| `rounded_lg` | 8 px | `well_box`, `field`, `segmented` frame, list rows, icon boxes |
| `rounded_xl` | 12 px | `card`, panels, sidebar |
| `rounded_2xl` | 16 px | `screen` panel, palette |
| `rounded(px(18.))` | 18 px | `island` |
| `ISLAND_ROW` | 12 px | Rows inside an `island` with `p(px(6.))`: their corners follow the island's |
| `rounded_full` / `rounded(px(999.))` | pill | Status dots, send/stop buttons, welcome primary button |

Recurring sizes:

| Where | Size |
| --- | --- |
| Window body | `px_1p5`, `pb_1p5`, `gap_1p5` between sidebar and panels; 6 px divider |
| `screen` | 32 px margin around the panel; fixed width or, without width, `size_full` with `max_w` 1280 |
| `screen_header` | `px_5`, `py_3`, `gap_3` |
| Screen body | `p_4`, or `px_4 pt_4` with sections in `gap_3` |
| Screen footer | `px_4`, `py_3`, `gap_2` |
| Card header | `px_3`, `py_2`, `gap_2`; body `px_3 pb_2` |
| Settings section | `card().p_4()` (`features/settings/layout.rs`) |
| Fields | `field` is 34 px tall; 30 px in compact bars |
| Chip card | 360 px wide, `p_3`, list with `max_h` 380 |

Current screen widths: Providers 640, Onboarding 720, Sessions and Usage 760, Settings 820; Profiles, Memory and Agents use `screen(None)` (Profiles caps it at 1100 × 760).

## Surfaces and components

Surface order, back to front: window (`window_bg`) → `panel` → `card` (`surface`) → `well_box`/`field` (`well`, sunken). `raised` marks what is selected. `island` and `screen` float, opaque.

| Piece | What it is | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `card()` | `rounded_xl` column, `surface`, `border` border | Tool cards, Settings sections, usage cards. |
| `well_box()` | `rounded_lg` column, `well`, `MONO`, `text_xs` | Code, command outputs, diffs, stderr. |
| `chip(text, color)` | 10.5 px pill: `color` text, `color.opacity(0.12)` background, `color.opacity(0.22)` border | Model, state, counts, "current", "N unsaved". |
| `kbd(text)` | 20 px key in `MONO` | Shortcut hints that are not an action on their own: `↑↓`, `←→`. |
| `key_button(id, text)` | `kbd` with a pointer; hover lifts the text to `fg` and the border to `petal().opacity(0.6)` | A hint that stands for one action in a footer legend or dialog (`↵` run/submit, `esc` cancel); add `.on_click` doing what the key does. Screen headers don't show `esc`: they have the close X, and Esc still closes. |
| `section_label(text)` | 10 px `SEMIBOLD` in `faint`, uppercase | Heading of a group. |
| `field()` | 34 px row, `well`, `border_strong` border | Frame for `Input::new(..).appearance(false)`, with an optional icon on the left. |
| `segmented(id, labels, selected, on_select)` | Text options inside a `well` | Two- or three-option toggles ("This project / All projects"). |
| `island(cx)` | Opaque floating card, radius 18, `border_strong().opacity(0.8)` border, shadow with `backdrop()` | Composer menus, chip cards, task island, onboarding groups. |
| `screen(width)` + `screen_header()` | Veil + centered panel; header row | Every overlay screen (see Patterns). |

```rust
// Card section with a title and sunken content.
ui::card().p_4().gap_2()
    .child(ui::section_label("Task"))
    .child(ui::well_box().px_3().py_2().text_color(ui::fg()).child(task));

// Search field.
ui::field()
    .child(Icon::new(IconName::Search).small().text_color(ui::faint()))
    .child(Input::new(&self.filter).appearance(false).small());

// Floating menu with rows that follow the island's corners.
ui::island(cx).p(px(6.)).child(
    div().px_3().py_1p5().rounded(px(ui::ISLAND_ROW))
        .hover(|s| s.bg(ui::surface_hover()))
        .child(label),
);
```

A gpui-component menu that should look like the island is opened with `Popover::appearance(false)` and its content wrapped in `ui::island(cx)` (see `chip_popover` below).

Presentation utilities in the same module: `split_path` (prefix `~/a/b/` and leaf, to show the prefix dimmed), `tail` (last N lines and how many were hidden) and `format_duration`.

## Motion

| Function | Duration | Curve | Effect | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `appear(id, el)` | 220 ms | `ease_out_quint` | Opacity 0→1 and relative `top` from 6 px to 0 | First appearance: rows, Settings content, sidebar, usage cards. |
| `appear_after(id, delay, rise, el)` | `delay` + 420 ms | ease-out-quint computed by hand (the wait stays linear) | Opacity and relative `top` from `rise` px | Staggered entrances (welcome, onboarding steps). |
| `pop_in(id, el)` | 340 ms | `spring` | Opacity and relative `top` from 12 px | Screens, dialogs, palette. |
| `popover_in(id, el)` | 300 ms | `spring` | Opacity only, without changing the measured size | Content inside an `island` or a popover. |
| `scrim(id)` | 220 ms | `ease_out_quint` | `backdrop()` veil fading in | Behind a panel (`screen` already adds it). |
| `pulse(el)` | 1400 ms, repeating at ~30 fps | `pulsating_between(0.35, 1.0)` | Breathes the opacity | Live indicators: activity dot, running agents, thinking `✿`. |
| `spinner(size, color)` | 800 ms a turn, ~30 fps | linear | The `Loader` icon turning | Rows that stay on screen while work runs: running tool cards, the model picker loading, running agents. |
| `shimmer(text, base, highlight)` | 2000 ms sweep, ~30 fps | smoothstep band | A highlight crossing the text | "Working…", "Thinking…", "Starting gentle-shell…". |
| `spring(t)` | — | — | Spring with ~3 % overshoot | Inside the animator for anything that opens. |

Guidelines:

- **One animation per id.** GPUI plays an animation once per `ElementId`. To repeat it, change the id with a counter (`ElementId::NamedInteger("effort-knob".into(), moves)` in `features/session/view/effort.rs`, `NamedInteger("max-surge".into(), run)` in `surge.rs`); to keep it from replaying when something reopens, the id must stay stable.
- **Live indicators are slow on purpose.** `pulse`, `spinner` and `shimmer` read one app clock and redraw their view every 33 ms instead of at the display's rate: a frame re-renders the whole view and its ancestors (the conversation, during a turn), so a 120 Hz dot would cost four times the work for no visible gain. Use them, not `Spinner`/`ShimmerText` or a repeating `with_animation`, for anything that stays on screen while work runs. They hold still with reduced motion.
- **Stagger with `appear_after`**: same base and a constant gap per step (`self.entrance + STEP_GAP * (index + 1)` with `STEP_GAP = 110 ms` in `features/onboarding/sequence.rs`).
- **Do not replay on scroll**: the conversation only applies `appear` to a row during `APPEAR_WINDOW` (300 ms) after it was first seen (`features/session/view/transcript_list.rs`).
- **`spring` goes in the animator, not as easing**: GPUI's easing must stay within 0..=1 and the spring goes past 1 (`pop_in` applies it inside the closure).
- **Move without pushing**: `appear`, `pop_in` and `appear_after` move with `.relative().top(..)`, which does not move flex siblings. Don't animate margins or sizes for an entrance. Since `.relative()` replaces the position, don't pass them an `.absolute()` element; wrap it instead.
- **Paint-only effects**: large effects draw in a `canvas` with `window.paint_quad`; they take no input and do not change layout. The surge shake is applied as an offset of the window root with `request_animation_frame`, without wrapping it in an animation, because that would change the key of every inner element (`features/workspace/render.rs`). A `Task` with a timer of the same duration clears the state when it ends (`Workspace::play_surge`, `WelcomeView::enter`).

## Brand

`crates/app/src/shared/banner.rs` draws the Gentle Shell banner (the braille rose and the "Gentle Shell" pixel art logotype) as real pixels. The art, the palettes and the `banner.json` format come from gentle-pi's `extensions/startup-banner.ts`.

| API | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `banner(config, scale, reveal)` | Rose + logotype at `scale` px per pixel (~175 px wide per scale unit). `reveal` in 0..=1 writes the logotype left to right and fades in the rose; animate it by passing `t` from a `with_animation`. |
| `BannerConfig { show_rose, show_text_logo, palette }` | Which parts to show and with which palette; `Default` shows everything in `Pink`. |
| `Palette::{Pink, Cyan, Yellow, Green}` | Rose, ink and shadow of the logotype in fixed RGB (they do not depend on the theme). |
| `read_config(config_home)` | Reads `<config>/banner.json` (`showRose`, `showTextLogo`, `color`); anything missing or invalid falls back to the default. |
| `pixel_rose(height, color)` | Only the rose, in a theme color (the onboarding hero uses it in `petal` or `success`). |
| `rose()` | Points and size of the rose, for other effects. |

The pixel art style shares rules: flat squares painted with `paint_quad`, slightly smaller than their cell so the grid shows (`dot * 0.55` in the rose, `dot * 0.9` in sprites); sprites defined as text (`#` body, `o` outline) like `LIPS` and `HEART` in `features/welcome/finale.rs`; colors derived from `petal()` when the effect belongs to the app.

- **Welcome finale** (`features/welcome/finale.rs`, `FINALE = 5600 ms`): the banner rewrites itself in slow motion, the rose throws 14 pixelated kisses (one in four is a heart in `petal`), "Sexyyyy" enters letter by letter with `spring` and the screen dissolves from `DISSOLVE = 0.86` with smoothstep.
- **Water reminder** (`features/hydration/drops.rs`, `DURATION = 6000 ms`): pixel drops (`DROP` sprite, `paint_sprite`) rain over the window, each splashing with a flat ripple where it lands, while a floating card fills a pixel glass drop by drop and says it's time for some water; everything fades from `FADE`. `hydration::show` plays it and `hydration::overlay(run)` paints it over the window root. Its water is `info()` and a lighter glint of the same hue. With reduced motion only the card shows.
- **Effort surge** (`shared/surge.rs`, `DURATION = 4400 ms` at max): a pixel comet runs along the window edge, the window shakes, the core hatches and the rose comes out. Every thinking level plays its own share of that show, each adding a beat to the one below (`surge::Level::of`): minimal and low run the comet along a quarter and half of the edge; medium closes the lap and flares the edge; high gathers the core while the window trembles gently; xhigh trembles harder and hatches the core (flash, shockwave, sparks); max adds the rose. `off` plays nothing. `SessionEvent::Effort(level)` triggers it once the backend accepts the level and `Workspace::play_surge` plays it; `surge::overlay(run, level)` paints and `surge::shake_at(elapsed, level)` gives the offset. Its colors (`spark`, `wine`) are derived from the hue of `petal()`.

## Icons

Icons are `IconName` from `gpui_kit::assets` (the Lucide catalog) and are drawn with `Icon::new(IconName::X)`, almost always `.small()` or `.xsmall()`. The binary only includes gpui-kit's default bundle plus the names listed in `ExtraIcons` (`crates/app/src/shared/assets.rs`); `AppAssets` looks in `ExtraIcons` first and then in `gpui_kit::assets::Assets`, and it is the source registered with `.with_assets(assets::AppAssets)` in `app/mod.rs`.

To use a Lucide icon that does not show up:

1. Add its name to the `gpui_kit::assets::icon_assets!(ExtraIcons, [...])` list, with a comment if it belongs to a specific feature.
2. Use it with `Icon::new(IconName::Name)`. No SVG is copied: the macro takes the one shipped with `gpui-kit-assets`.

A custom SVG, outside Lucide, would need one more branch in `AppAssets::load`; none exists today.

Icon color: `muted` in screen headers and neutral cards, `faint` inside fields and in empty states, the tone color in states and extension cards, `champagne` in Settings sections.

## Patterns

### Overlay screen

Settings, Providers, Usage, Sessions, Profiles, Memory and Agents follow the same shape (`features/usage/view.rs`, `features/sessions/render.rs`). Onboarding uses `ui::screen` without `screen_header`: its hero acts as the header and the close X floats at the top right. The palette (`features/palette/view.rs`) repeats the frame by hand (`screen_bg`, `rounded_2xl`, `border_strong`, `shadow_2xl`) with a fixed height of 560 px so it does not jump while filtering.

```rust
let (backdrop, panel) = ui::screen(Some(760.));
backdrop.occlude().child(ui::pop_in(
    "usage-screen",
    panel.w_full().max_w(px(760.))
        .child(
            ui::screen_header()
                .child(Icon::new(IconName::Gauge).small().text_color(ui::muted()))
                .child(div().flex_shrink_0().text_base().font_weight(FontWeight::SEMIBOLD)
                    .text_color(ui::fg()).child("Usage"))
                .child(div().flex_1().min_w_0().truncate().text_xs()
                    .text_color(ui::muted()).child(subtitle))
                .child(ui::key_button("usage-esc", "esc")
                    .on_click(cx.listener(|_, _, _, cx| cx.emit(UsageEvent::Close))))
                .child(Button::new("usage-close").ghost().xsmall().icon(Icon::new(IconName::X))
                    .on_click(cx.listener(|_, _, _, cx| cx.emit(UsageEvent::Close)))),
        )
        .child(div().id("usage-body").flex_1().min_h_0().overflow_y_scroll().p_4().child(body))
        .child(footer),
))
```

- Header, in this order: `small` icon in `muted`, `text_base SEMIBOLD` title, subtitle that takes the remaining space and truncates, optional actions (spinner, count chip, `segmented`, `ghost().xsmall()` buttons with tooltip) and the close X (`ghost().xsmall()` with `IconName::X`). No `esc` badge in the header: Esc closes every screen anyway.
- The body is the only part that scrolls (`flex_1().min_h_0().overflow_y_scroll()` with an id).
- The view does not handle Esc: it emits its `Close` event and the `Workspace` removes it (`on_close_overlay`). The veil uses `.occlude()` so clicks do not pass through to what is behind; only the palette closes on a click on the veil.

### Full screen: welcome

`features/welcome/` takes up the whole window (below the 36 px title bar on Windows and Linux; on macOS it leaves a drag area below the traffic lights).

- `screen_bg()` background with a gradient from the top: `petal().opacity(0.10)` while installing, `success().opacity(0.10)` when everything required is ready and `petal().opacity(0.18)` during the entrance.
- Banner at scale 2.6, writing itself during `INTRO` (1500 ms); when ready it switches to `Palette::Green` with `pop_in`. Heading (34 px `BOLD`) and footer enter with `appear_after` at `AFTER_INTRO` (1100 ms). If the screen is shown again, `intro_done` draws everything in place without animating.
- Content centered with `max_w(px(680.))`; 88 px footer with `px_10`; ↵ runs the primary button.

### Session status chips

`features/session/view/activity.rs` draws the activity line above the composer. On the left, while the agent works: `pulse` of a 6 px `petal` dot, clock in `MONO` and `muted`, a 1×10 px separator in `border_strong`, `✿ phase…` in `petal` and the current tool, truncated, in `muted`. On the right, the chips.

Every new chip uses `chip_popover(id, icon, color, label, title, count, body)`: a `ghost().xsmall()` `Button` with `text_color(color)` that opens a `Popover` anchored `BottomRight`, 360 px wide, with `appearance(false)`, content in `ui::island(cx)` + `ui::popover_in`. The card shows icon and title (`text_sm MEDIUM`), the count in `MONO` and a scrollable list; `body` builds the rows only on open. Chip color: `accent` if something is running, `muted` at rest, `faint` for passive information (token usage). In panels narrower than `TINY`, extension states collapse into a single chip.

### Conversation cards

Tool cards (`render_card` in `features/session/view.rs`) and extension message cards (`features/session/view/cards.rs`) share a shape:

- `ui::card().w_full().overflow_hidden()`; if the tone is danger or warning, `border_color(color.opacity(0.35))`.
- Header `px_3 py_2 gap_2`: `small` icon (tone or `muted`), 13 px `SEMIBOLD` title in `champagne`, truncated, optional chip (`info` for tools, the tone for extensions), subject in `MONO` 12 px `muted`, `+n` in `success` and `−n` in `danger`, `faint` chevron if it collapses. A collapsible header has a `surface_hover` hover.
- Body `px_3 pb_2`: 13 px text in `muted`; outputs in `MONO` 12 px (`CustomBody::Tail`); Markdown with `TextView` in `fg`. Long content is cut and offers "N more lines" / "Show less".
- The tone (`Tone::{Success, Danger, Warning, Info, Muted}`) is decided by a pure function from the type and the `details` (`custom_look`), with tests.

### Buttons and footers

| Rule | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Secondary `ghost()` buttons on the left, a spacer (`div().flex_1()` or `ml_auto()`), the primary `primary()` last on the right. | Footer of Sessions, Usage, welcome, Profiles. |
| Sizes: `small()` in footers, `xsmall()` in headers and bars, `large()` only in the welcome. | |
| Icon-only buttons have a `tooltip`. | Refresh in headers. |
| Work in progress: `.loading(busy)` and the label says so ("Installing…"); `.disabled(..)` when the action is not possible. | `welcome-primary`, `usage-refresh`, `welcome-recheck`. |
| Destructive: `danger()` in confirmations (Discard, Delete), `danger().outline()` to stop agents. | `features/profiles/view/confirm.rs`, `features/session/agents.rs`. |
| Inline confirm: `outline()`; cancel: `ghost()` with "Cancel". | Rename profile, custom model. |
| Pill (`rounded(px(999.))`) only for the composer's send/stop and the welcome primary button. | `features/session/view/composer.rs` |

Typical screen footer: `h_flex().px_4().py_3().gap_2().border_t_1().border_color(ui::border())`, with hints (`kbd`/`key_button` + `text_xs muted` text) or a status line on the left.

### Empty, loading and error

| State | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| Loading | `h_flex().gap_2().text_sm().text_color(ui::muted())` + `Spinner::new().small()` (in `muted` or `accent`) + "Reading sessions…". Inline, `Spinner::new().xsmall()`. Brief loads only; a spinner that can stay up through a whole turn is `ui::spinner`. |
| Reloading with data | The list stays and the refresh button shows `.loading(..)`. |
| Empty | `v_flex().items_center().py_8().gap_2()`, icon in `faint` (`Inbox`, `Layers`) and a `text_sm muted` sentence that says what to do ("No profiles left. Create one with New."). |
| Error | `text_sm` text in `danger` with a `ghost` "Retry" button; or a `card` with `border_color(ui::danger().opacity(0.35))`, `CircleAlert` icon, `section_label` and the message; technical output, if any, goes in a `well_box`. |
| Action result | `text_xs` line with an `xsmall` icon: `muted` + `Info`, `success` + `CircleCheck`, `danger` + `CircleAlert` (Profiles footer). |

## Do and don't

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Use `ui::*` for every color and the `ui.rs` pieces for cards, fields and chips. | Write `rgb(..)`/`hsla(..)` in a view, except pixel art with its own colors. |
| Separate zones with space and a change of surface. | Add borders or lines inside panels, cards or the chrome. |
| Reserve `petal` for what is live and primary. | Use `petal` or `accent` as the background of large blocks. |
| Secondary text in `muted`, metadata in `faint`, values in `MONO`. | Bump everything to `fg` or `text_sm`. |
| Open screens with `screen` + `pop_in` and menus with `island` + `popover_in`. | Use the stock popover frame or a custom veil. |
| Stable animation ids; a counter in the id only to repeat it. | Ids that change on every render (the animation restarts endlessly). |
| Large effects in a `canvas`, without input and with a `Task` that clears them. | Wrap the window root in an animation. |
| Test in a light theme (e.g. Catppuccin Latte) and with transparency at maximum. | Assume dark mode or an opaque background. |
| Make a key hint that stands for one action a `key_button` with the key's handler. | Leave an `esc`/`↵` cap that looks pressable but ignores the mouse. |

## Checklist for a new screen

1. The view lives in its feature (`features/<name>/`); anything generic used by more than one feature goes to `shared/ui.rs`, not to the view.
2. `ui::screen(Some(width))` (640–820) or `None`, wrapped in `ui::pop_in("<name>-screen", ..)` and with `.occlude()` on the veil.
3. Header with `screen_header`: `muted` icon, `text_base SEMIBOLD` title, truncated subtitle, `ghost().xsmall()` actions with tooltip, and the close X; the view emits `Close` and the `Workspace` handles it.
4. Scrollable body with an id; groups in `card()` with `section_label`; fields with `field()` + `Input::appearance(false)`; toggles with `segmented`.
5. Loading, empty and error states with the shapes above; nothing stays blank while reading.
6. Footer with secondary `ghost` buttons on the left and a single `primary` on the right; `.loading` and `.disabled` reflect work in progress.
7. New icons added to `ExtraIcons`.
8. Animations only with `appear`/`appear_after`/`pop_in`/`popover_in`/`pulse`, with stable ids.
9. Reviewed in a light theme, in a dark theme and with different transparencies.
